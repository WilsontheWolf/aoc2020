# Advent of Code 2020
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Usage
You need node installed to use this.

This has a cli to choose solutions or you can run files directly. First save your input into a file called `input#.txt` where `#` is the day number. 

If you want to use the command line interface run: 
```sh
yarn install
#or 
npm install
```
Than you can run `node .` to start the cli.

If you don't want to use the cli just run `node day#pt#.js` where the numbers are for your day and part number.
